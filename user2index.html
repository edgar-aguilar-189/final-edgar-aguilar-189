		<h2 class="rightsection"> User2 is a 25-year-old student who enjoys escapology, watching sport and watching television. He is addicted to video games, something which his friend Elliott Shona Oliver pointed out when he was 15. The problem intensified in 2015. In 2016, User2 lost his job as a secretary at a law firm as a result of his addiction. He is Scottish. He is currently at college, studying philosophy, politics and economics. He has a severe phobia of blood. Physically, User2 is slightly overweight but otherwise in good shape. He is tall with fair skin, brown hair and blue eyes. He grew up in a middle class neighbourhood. His mother left when he was young, leaving him with his father, who was a drunk. He is currently in a relationship with Alexandra Isla Lane. Alexandra is the same age as him and works as a student.
